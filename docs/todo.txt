	Milestone 2: (Black Swan)
		Update Running Model (Rules only)
			Revise model leads to model tab (and current request URI is somehow stored in model tab URI?)
			Then, when model is updated, success msgbox gives link back to request.
			
			Action Items:
				Update button should send new model to server.
				Server should compare models to see if change is allowed. (eeeasy)
				If no, revert model (and explain)
				If yes, apply new model (and declare success)
				'Revise Model' button should redirect to the model screen
					with cached request
				Update success should direct to return to pending request
				Pending request should be noted in UI with [continue] link.
