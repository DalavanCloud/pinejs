Canvas TODO:
	Milestone 1: SBVR Editor
		Highlighting & Autocompletion with OMeta parser
		Component division (editor - platform)
		File loading & Saving
		Chrome App

	Milestone 2: (Black Swan)
		Update Running Model (Rules only)
			Revise model leads to model tab (and current request URI is somehow stored in model tab URI?)
			Then, when model is updated, success msgbox gives link back to request.
			
			Action Items:
				Update button should send new model to server.
				Server should compare models to see if change is allowed. (eeeasy)
				If no, revert model (and explain)
				If yes, apply new model (and declare success)
				'Revise Model' button should redirect to the model screen
					with cached request
				Update success should direct to return to pending request
				Pending request should be noted in UI with [continue] link.
				
		
		Renaming:
			SBVRwithSails -> Mondat
			standalone.html -> index.html
			'my first db' -> 'mondat' //or something app-specific?
			
		BackURIs
		
		Add-Transactions
			Requires proper querying?!

		Client:
			keep client_onAir_ in memmory, not localStorage to avoid interference between sessions.
	
		Server:
			Move localStorage to a database table. 
				Can't rely on localStorage in the server. Also, first step towards multi-project.
			check: do locks still lock resources? (probably not according to gc bug)
		
		Protocol:
			JSON.stringify all responses (esp. the models)
			Send custom failure headers also (not just success)
			Have default headers (200 OK / 404 Not Found?)
			
		Bugs:
			Cmod bug - fixes with reload, odd little thing.
				Replicate
		
	Milestone 3: (IAH)
		Server-side. (Node.js?)
		Logical operators (and/or)
		Attributes
		Datatypes
		User Access
		Optimized schema

Done:
	Client:
		bug: When loading the page on the data editor, and returning to the model, the editor doesn't highlight.
		UI:
			bug: delete panel has no button
	Server:
		bug: fix garbage collection for transactions.
		bug: Transaction barf. Why?
		->> Code org: Break out DB validation into its own function..
			-->>> must make execute() into an async-friendly function, which may allow halving it also.
				--->>>> standardize arguments of success/failureCallback, and create proxies for client call.
		++ validateDB reorg
		
	Parser:
		bug: can't parse rules that end with a space. Should accept spaces or fullstop at the end of a rule.
			(esp. bad since autocomplete adds a space)
			
	Open Source Release
		Apply Apache 2.0

Transaction Notes

add a locked resource? SLock on the collection then posting on the CR of the coll which produces an XLOCKED resource?
slock collection? lock resource with ID 0

how do I work with conditional representations? 'lock {that is exclusive} has conditional representation'
'Conditional Representation' has fields 'fieldname' and 'fieldvalue' and 'lock_id'
POST .. no new id. gets stored in conditionals with a special (negative) id to be replaced with another on commit.
PUT .. empty all previous fields and add new fields to CR
DELETE .. empty all previous fields and add special field to CR'__delete':true
